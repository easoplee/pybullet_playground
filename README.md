This repository is for pybullet development of visual-based manipulation tasks.

### Scene Probing

The panda arm moves its wrist joint to capture depth images from the scene and convert these into the scene point cloud.

### pointcloud_test.ipynb

Test code to convert a pair of color+depth images into a single point cloud data.

### TODO:
- collect multiple color+depth images during scene probing.
- generate scene point cloud using multiple depth images.
