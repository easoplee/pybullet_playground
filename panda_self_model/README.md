# Panda Self-Model

## About

### 
This folder contains a pre-trained self-model for the 7-joint panda arm with a cylinder as an end effector.

The model, f, in a nutshell:
$f(x, y, z, \alpha) => sdf \in \mathbb{R}$, where $(x,y,z)$ is a spatial coordinate and $\alpha$ is a 7-vector in which each element represents the joint position of each of the Panda arm joint.
